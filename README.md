🌾 FoodLink – Ending Hunger Through Connection

**FoodLink** is a mobile-first web app built to tackle **SDG 2: Zero Hunger** by connecting **farmers, food donors, NGOs, and families**.
We reduce food waste while improving food security in low-resource communities.

---

🚀 Problem

* ❌ 1/3 of food produced globally is wasted.
* ❌ Farmers in rural areas lack access to markets → low income.
* ❌ Families and vulnerable groups face hunger and high food prices.
* ❌ NGOs & restaurants waste surplus food that could feed others.

---

 💡 Our Solution

A **digital food network** that:

* ✅ Connects **farmers** to households/schools (fair direct sales).
* ✅ Lets **restaurants/households donate surplus food** to NGOs.
* ✅ Gives **families access to affordable/free meals**.
* ✅ Works even in **low-resource settings** with SMS/USSD support.

**One app. Three communities. Zero hunger.**

---

 ✨ Features (MVP Demo)

* 🌽 **Farm-to-Market Direct Sales** – Farmers list produce, buyers purchase directly.
* 🍲 **Food Surplus Donations** – Restaurants & homes donate food, NGOs collect.
* 🤖 **Smart Matching** – Matches donors with nearest families/NGOs.
* 📞 **Offline Support** – Basic USSD/SMS fallback for farmers without smartphones.

---

 📊 Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React + TailwindCSS
* **Backend (mocked for demo):** Node.js + Express (simple API)
* **Database (demo):** JSON (simulated, no DB needed for hackathon)
* **Deployment:** Vercel / Netlify (1-click deploy)
* **Version Control:** GitHub
